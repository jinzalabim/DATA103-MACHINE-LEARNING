# Gradient Boosting from Scratch  

## Overview  

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of **Gradient Boosting** from scratch, showcasing the mathematical principles and coding techniques behind one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms. The project is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the boosting methodology by building a model without relying on existing libraries for Gradient Boosting.

## Objectives  

- Understand the core concepts of Gradient Boosting.  
- Implement Gradient Boosting from the ground up using Python.  
- Illustrate the step-by-step process of boosting, loss minimization, and tree-based learners.  
- Compare the custom implementation with established libraries for performance benchmarking.  

## Features  

- **Custom Gradient Boosting Implementation**: Includes logic for additive model training, gradient calculation, and weak learner updates.  
- **Tree-Based Learners**: Demonstrates the use of decision trees as base models for boosting.  
- **Loss Functions**: Provides implementation for loss minimization, including common loss functions like mean squared error.  
- **Evaluation**: Measures performance and compares the custom implementation against library-based models.  

## Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- Install the necessary Python libraries:  
  ```bash  
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
