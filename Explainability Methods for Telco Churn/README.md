# Explainability Methods for Machine Learning Models: Telco Churn Dataset  

## Overview  

This project explores various **explainability methods** for machine learning models, applied to a **Random Forest classifier** trained on the **Telco Churn dataset**. The goal is to understand and interpret the model's predictions using methods such as **SHAP**, **LIME**, and **PDP**, with a focus on identifying key drivers that impact the model's performance in predicting customer churn.

## Objectives  

- Understand and implement explainability methods for machine learning models: SHAP, LIME, and PDP.  
- Analyze and identify the key drivers that influence the Random Forest classifier’s predictions on the Telco Churn dataset.  
- Document the analysis process and summarize key insights from the chosen methods.  

## Features  

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Explanation of model predictions based on Shapley values, highlighting the contribution of each feature to a particular prediction.  
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: Local explanations for individual predictions, revealing how features influence predictions in the vicinity of the specific data point.  
- **PDP (Partial Dependence Plot)**: Visualizations that show the relationship between features and the predicted outcome, helping understand the effect of features on model predictions.  

## Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  ```bash  
  pip install shap lime matplotlib scikit-learn pandas  

## Implementation  

### Training the Model:  
- The Random Forest classifier is trained on the Telco Churn dataset. If a pre-trained model is not provided, the model will be trained using the dataset’s features to predict customer churn.  

### Explainability Methods:  
- **SHAP**: Calculate Shapley values for the predictions, revealing how each feature contributes to the final prediction.  
- **LIME**: Use LIME to generate local explanations for individual predictions, making the model’s decisions more interpretable for specific instances.  
- **PDP**: Generate Partial Dependence Plots to visualize the relationship between key features and churn predictions.  

### Key Feature Identification:  
- Identify the top 3-5 features that have the most significant positive or negative influence on the model’s churn predictions.
